# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains all the work I completed for the Data Structures and Algorithms course during my third semester in the Information Systems program at Universitas Indonesia. The course focused on understanding and implementing various data structures and algorithms to solve computational problems efficiently.

The Data Structures and Algorithms course covers key concepts in organizing and manipulating data, with an emphasis on the following topics:
- Basic Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Advanced Data Structures: Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- Algorithm Design: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer
- Algorithm Efficiency: Time and space complexity analysis using Big O notation

Hope it helps.
